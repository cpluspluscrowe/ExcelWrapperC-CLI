# ExcelWrapperCpp/CLI

Started on 1/23/2017.  Those who've used C++/CLI's Microsoft::Office::Interop::Excel have seen that their Excel support is a bit rough.

  Any user will find themselves casting any worksheets, ranges, and using Type::Missing often within their functions.
  
  This wrapper is meant to act and look just like the C# implementation.
  
    When I haven't updated something yet, you will find that the wrapper gives you public access to the raw Excel object.
