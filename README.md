# ExcelWrapperCpp-CLI, Last Update: 2/2/17
Better Wrapper for Excel using C++/CLI.  Uses managed classes.  Made to feel like C#/VBA's Excel.  

Interfaces for:

Excel.Application, destructor to Quit() when the program finishes

Workbook

Worksheet

Range, and Value Functions

Cells, and Value Functions

Worksheet.UsedRange.Rows.Count


There is also a portion written in native C++.  This is for easy conversion from Excel Range values to std::string or double.
